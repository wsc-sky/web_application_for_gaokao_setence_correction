A verb can express:<br><br>\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\n<ul>\r\r\r\n<li> A physical action (e.g., <i>to swim</i>, <i>to write</i>, <i>to climb</i>).\r\r\r\n<li> A mental action (e.g., <i>to think</i>, <i>to guess</i>, <i>to consider</i>).\r\r\r\n<li> A state of being (e.g., <i>to be</i>, <i>to exist</i>, <i>to appear</i>).\r\r\r\n</ul>\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\nThe verbs which express a state of being are the ones which take a little practice to spot, but, actually, they are the most common. The most common verb is the verb <i>to be</i>.

(These verbs express physical actions.)<br><br>\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\n<ul>\r\r\r\n<li> She <b>sells</b> pegs and lucky heather.</li>\r\r\r\n(In this example, the word <i>sells</i> is a verb. It expresses the physical activity <i>to sell</i>.)<br>\r\r\r\n<li> The doctor <b>wrote</b> the prescription.</li>\r\r\r\n(In this example, the word <i>wrote</i> is a verb. It expresses the physical activity <i>to write</i>.)<br>\r\r\r\n<li> Alison <b>bought</b> a ticket.</li>\r\r\r\n(The word <i>bought</i> is a verb. It expresses the physical activity <i>to buy</i>.)\r\r\r\n</ul>\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\n<h2>Verbs Express Mental Actions Too</h2>\r\r\r\nAs we covered at the start, verbs do not necessarily express physical actions like the ones above. They can express mental actions too:<br><br>\r\r\r\nExample:<br><br>\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\n<ul>\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\n<li> She <b>considers</b> the job done.</li>\r\r\r\n(The word <i>considers</i> is a verb.

It expresses the mental activity <i>to guess</i>.)<br>\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\n<li> I <b>thought</b> the same thing.</li>\r\r\r\n(The word <i>thought</i> is a verb. It expresses the mental activity <i>to think</i>.)\r\r\r\n</ul>\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\n<h2>Verbs Express a State of Being</h2>\r\r\r\nA small, but extremely important group of verbs do not express any activity at all. The most important verb in this group &ndash; arguably of all &ndash; is the verb <i>to be</i>. As already mentioned, this is seen in forms like <i>is</i>, <i>are</i>, <i>were</i>, <i>was</i>, <i>will be</i>, etc. <br><br>\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\nSome real examples:<br><br>\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\n<ul>\r\r\r\n<li> Edwina <b>is</b> the largest elephant in this area.</li>\r\r\r\n(The word <i>is</i> is a verb from the verb <i>to be</i>.)<br>\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\n<li> It <b>was</b> a joke.</li>\r\r\r\n(The word <i>was</i> is a verb from the verb <i>to be</i>.)<br>\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\n<li> I <b>am</b>.</li>\r\r\r\n(The word <i>am</i> is a verb from the verb <i>to be</i>.)<br>(Point of interest: <i>I am</i> is the shortest sentence in English.)\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\n</ul>\r\r\r\n'),(4,4,'\r\r\r\n<div class=\"tacenter\">\r\r\r\n<h2 class=\"tacenter\"><b>Verbs and Tenses</b></h2>\r\r\r\n<p class=\"tacenter\"><strong>\r\r\r\nSimple Present | \r\r\r\nSimple Future | \r\r\r\nSimple Past <br/>|\r\r\r\nContinuous | \r\r\r\nFuture Continuous | \r\r\r\nPast Continuous <br/> |\r\r\r\nPresent Perfect Simple | \r\r\r\nPresent Perfect Futur | \r\r\r\nPresent Perfect Continuous<br/> |\r\r\r\nPast Perfect Simple | \r\r\r\nPast Perfect Continuous <br/> |\r\r\r\nThe Future</strong></p>\r\r\r\n</div>\r\r\r\n \r\r\r\n \r\r\r\n<p class=\"tacenter\"><i class=\"icon-time icon-4x\"></i></p>\r\r\r\n<p>It\'s all about time.
